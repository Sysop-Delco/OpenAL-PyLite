# OpenAL-PyLite
Lightweight OpenAL Soft Python Wrapper

For the latest version of OpenAL-Soft go to "https://openal-soft.org/". There's a readme file in the archive with further instructions if you wish to install it, but otherwise you can go into the /bin/x32 or /bin/x64 folders depending, and rename soft_oal.dll to OpenAL32.dll, and pair it with the openal python script.

To get started, copy openal.py and OpenAL32.dll into your current working directory with your script. To use it import it into your script and checkout the examples provided. Thats it! Note that if the current working directory doesn't match the directory where the script and dll are, it may throw a dll error, and be sure not to have conflicting versions of OpenAL installed.

You can find available OpenAL documentation here: https://www.openal.org/documentation/
